I am a software developer with a passion for creating applications that improves the lives of others. I have a strong background in web development and have worked with a wide range of technologies. I am currently working on a project that aims to improve the lives of people in Sri Lanka.

With the current pandemic, as more and more people trying to get into the tech industry, my goal with this blog is to help them master the skills they need to be successful in the industry. I hope to be able to share my knowledge and experience with you.
